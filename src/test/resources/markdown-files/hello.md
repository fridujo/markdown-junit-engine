# Title

```java
public class Machin {

    public static void main() {
        new ArrayList<>(); // will fail due to missing imprt
    }
}
```

### SubSubsection

```js
// should be ignored
```

```java
public interface Machin {
}
```

Using the same type name in two distinct code blocks should not be an issue.

```java
public class Machin {
}
```

## SubSection

Jumping back from level 3 to level 2 should create the associated tree structure

```java
public interface Machin {
}
```
